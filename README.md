# AI Pathfinder – Blind Search Visualization

> Step-by-step visualization of BFS, DFS, UCS, DLS, IDDFS, and Bidirectional search on a grid with static walls and dynamic obstacles. Python + Pygame.

This project will visualize uninformed search algorithms (BFS, DFS, UCS, DLS, IDDFS, Bidirectional) on a grid with static walls and dynamic obstacles. The GUI will show how each algorithm explores the map step by step and how the agent re-plans when the path is blocked.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Pygame

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run instructions and project layout will be updated as the code is added.
